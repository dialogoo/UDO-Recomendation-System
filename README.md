**UDO** is a human-centric recommendation engine that prioritizes **user agency** and **data ownership**. Instead of black-box predictions, UDO empowers users to:
- Write and update **primary preferences**, **secondary desires**, and **personal notes**
- Apply **likes, scores, or flags** to items
- **See and revise** the full list of their inputs
- Explore **transparent, adaptive recommendations** based on their own logic

> **Motto**: *User Data Ownership*

## Features

- **Expressive input system**  
  Users can define personal tastes and multi-layered desires using structured free-text.

- **Reversible feedback**  
  Likes, scores, or reactions are not final — users can **review and reset** them.

- **Transparent logic**  
  A "Personalized Recommendations" tab lets users trace **why** a suggestion appears.

- **You own your data**  
  UDO stores data locally or in a user-controlled backend. Nothing is hidden or harvested.

- **Composable architecture**  
  Designed for integration with marketplaces, media apps, or any user-facing system.

## System Design

UDO is built around 4 core components:

1. **Input Engine**  
   Structured fields and open text (primary/secondary/... preferences, contextual info).

2. **Feedback Tracker**  
   Likes, dislikes, scores, emotional tags — all accesible, editable and reviewable.

3. **Recommendation Core**  
   Uses LLM + rules-based filtering to propose suggestions from a public or private catalog.

4. **User Dashboard**  
   View, revise, or remove inputs; see how recommendations change (in real time?).

> UDO isn't just a recommender — it's a *mirror of your intent*.
